# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Multilingual Research Ingestion Module for Athena

## 1. Overview

**Product Name:** Athena Multilingual Research Ingestion Module  
**Target Platform:** JavaScript Frontend, Python Backend  
**Primary Users:** DoD Researchers, Academics, Analysts, Collaborators  
**Purpose:**  
Enable Athena to automatically ingest academic research files in multiple languages, convert them to English, extract and generate comprehensive metadata, and ensure robust cybersecurity throughout the ingestion pipeline. This will facilitate seamless discovery, collaboration, and knowledge sharing within the Athena ecosystem.

## 2. Objectives & Goals

- **Automate ingestion** of academic research files in diverse formats and languages.
- **Standardize content** by translating all ingested documents to English.
- **Extract and generate metadata** (author, abstract, keywords, publication date).
- **Integrate cybersecurity** controls to ensure data hygiene and prevent malicious uploads.
- **Enhance collaboration** by making research easily discoverable and accessible.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. File Ingestion

- **Batch Upload:** Support for multiple files in a single session.
- **File Size Limit:** Configurable (default: 50MB per file).

### 3.2. Language Detection & Translation

- **Automatic Language Detection:** Identify the language of each uploaded document.
- **Supported Languages:** Minimum 20 major languages (including but not limited to Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Russian, Spanish).
- **Translation Engine:** Integrate with high-accuracy translation APIs (e.g., Google Cloud Translation, Microsoft Translator, DoD-approved translation service).
- **Fallback Mechanism:** Notify users if translation fails; allow manual language selection.

### 3.3. Metadata Extraction

- **Fields to Extract:**
  - Author(s)
  - Abstract
  - Keywords
  - Publication Date
  - Title
  - Source/Journal (if available)
- **Extraction Methods:** NLP-based parsing, template matching, manual correction UI.
- **Metadata File:** Generate a standardized JSON or XML metadata file for each ingested document.

### 3.4. User Interface (JavaScript Frontend)

- **Upload Dashboard:** Intuitive interface for uploading, tracking, and managing files.
- **Progress Indicators:** Real-time feedback on upload, processing, translation, and extraction stages.
- **Error Handling:** Clear, actionable error messages for failed uploads or extractions.
- **Preview:** Display extracted metadata and translated abstract for user review.
- **Manual Corrections:** Allow users to edit metadata before final submission.

### 3.5. Backend Processing (Python)

- **Queue Management:** Asynchronous processing pipeline for scalability.
- **Document Parsing:** Use libraries (e.g., PyPDF2, python-docx, BeautifulSoup) to extract text.
- **Translation Integration:** Modular translation service with logging and error handling.
- **Metadata Extraction:** NLP models (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) for robust information extraction.
- **Storage:** Securely store original, translated documents, and metadata in Athenaâ€™s repository.

## 4. Cybersecurity & Data Hygiene

- **Malware Scanning:** Integrate with antivirus engines (e.g., ClamAV) to scan all uploads.
- **File Type Validation:** Strict whitelisting of allowed file types.
- **Sandboxing:** Process files in isolated environments to prevent system compromise.
- **Audit Logging:** Record all actions for traceability and compliance.
- **Access Controls:** Enforce user authentication and role-based permissions for ingestion actions.
- **Data Encryption:** Encrypt files at rest and in transit using DoD-approved standards.
- **Vulnerability Management:** Regularly update dependencies and monitor for security advisories.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ingest and process 95% of files within 2 minutes (for files 98% of valid academic files are successfully ingested and translated.
- **Metadata Accuracy:** >95% accuracy in extracted metadata fields.
- **Cybersecurity Incidents:** Zero successful malware uploads or breaches via ingestion.
- **User Satisfaction:** >90% positive feedback on ingestion workflow.

## 8. Technical Architecture

| Layer            | Technology/Approach                       | Responsibilities                                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend         | React.js (or Angular/Vue)                 | Upload UI, progress feedback, metadata review            |
| API Gateway      | RESTful API (Python Flask/FastAPI)        | File upload, status polling, error handling              |
| Processing       | Python microservices (Celery, RabbitMQ)   | Parsing, translation, metadata extraction, validation    |
| Storage          | Secure object storage (S3, DoD-compliant) | Store original, translated docs, metadata                |
| Security         | ClamAV, sandboxing, RBAC, audit logging   | File scanning, isolation, access control, traceability   |

## 9. Dependencies

- Translation APIs (external or DoD-approved)
- Document parsing and NLP libraries
- Secure storage and access management systems
- Cybersecurity tools (antivirus, sandboxing solutions)

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                 | Mitigation Strategy                          |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Inaccurate translation of technical terms | Use domain-adapted translation models; allow user review |
| Malicious file uploads                | Multi-layered scanning and sandboxing        |
| Metadata extraction errors            | Allow manual corrections; continuous model training |
| API downtime (translation or storage) | Implement retry logic and fallback messaging |
